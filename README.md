Implementing email verification for user registration and requiring email confirmation before allowing users to log in is a common security practice. Here's a high-level explanation of how you can achieve this:

1. User Registration:
   When a user registers on your website or application, collect their basic information, including a valid email address.

2. Generate a Unique Verification Token:
   Upon successful registration, generate a unique verification token associated with the user account. This token is typically a long random string.

3. Store the Token and User Status:
   Store the generated token and set the user's account status to "Unverified" in your database. You need a column in your user table to store the verification status and another one for the verification token.

4. Send Verification Email:
   Send an email to the user's provided email address containing a verification link.
   The verification link should include the generated token, for example: `https://yourwebsite.com/verify?token=generated_token`.
   The email should clearly instruct the user to click on the verification link to confirm their registration.

5. Verification Endpoint
   Create a server endpoint (e.g., `/verify`) that handles verification requests.
   When users click on the verification link, the server should:
   Check if the provided token is valid and matches the one stored in the database.
   If valid, update the user's account status to "Verified."

6. User Authentication with Verification Check
   Modify your login logic to check whether the user's account is verified before allowing them to log in.
   If the account is not verified, deny login and prompt the user to verify their email first.
   If the account is verified, allow the user to log in as usual.

Key Considerations:

Security Measures:
Implement proper security measures to protect against email spoofing and token tampering.
Use secure and encrypted connections for email communication.

Token Expiry:
Consider implementing token expiry to enhance security. Tokens should have a limited lifespan.

Email Service:
Utilize a reliable email service to ensure that verification emails are delivered promptly and reliably.

User Experience:
Provide clear instructions in the verification email to guide users through the process.
Consider implementing a user-friendly UI for handling email verification on your website or application.

By following these steps, you can enhance the security of your user registration process and ensure that users can only log in after verifying their email addresses.
